If you haven't already connected your GitLab.com account, Alexa will prompt you to link your account before executing the command.\n\nYou can use the following account for testing:\n\nUsername: <insert username here before submissions>\nPassword: <insert password here before submissions>\n\nBelow are some different ways to invoke the skill and the expected response from the skill. Note that most of the responses are randomly selected from a number of possible responses, so the dialog may not line up exactly with the conversations below.
