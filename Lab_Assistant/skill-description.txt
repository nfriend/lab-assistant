// This is the source of the "description" field in skill.json
// It's really hard to edit something this big in a single field of JSON,
// so this file is used to edit the contents, and then they can be converted
// into a JSON-friendly string (i.e. with \n's and escaped double quotes).
//
// I usually accomplish this by doing something silly like copying this file's contents
// into the browser's dev tools like
//
//     var something = { str: `
//     <paste content here>
//     ` };
//
// and then running
// 
//     something
//
// which should print the string in a nicely JSON-friendly format.
