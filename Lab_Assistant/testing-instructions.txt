Open the skill by saying "Alexa, open Lab Assistant".

Connect your account by saying "Alexa, connect my GitLab.com account". Alexa should prompt you to open the Alexa app and complete account linking.

Alternatively, you can skip the connection step above and simply run any of the commands described below.  If you haven't already connected your GitLab.com account, Alexa will prompt you to link your account before executing the command.

You can use the following account for testing:

Username: <insert username here before submission>
Password: <insert password here before submission>

Below are some different ways to invoke the skill and the expected response from the skill. Note that most of the responses are randomly selected from a number of possible responses, so the dialog may not line up exactly with the conversations below.  The overall content and message, however, should be the the same.

### Launching

When launching the skill for the first time:

User:  Alexa, open Lab Assistant.
Alexa: Hello! Looks like this is your first visit! I'll explain a few things you can do, and feel free to say "help" at any time for assistance. You can trigger a pipeline by saying "run a new pipeline." Catch up on your workload by saying "to-dos", "issues", or "merge requests". What would you like to do?

When the skill has been launched previously:

User:  Alexa, open Lab Assistant.
Alexa: Welcome! How can I help?

User:  Yes.
Alexa: You assigned merge request number 1 to yourself.
Alexa: You assigned issue number 1 to yourself.

### Merge requests

User:  How many merge requests do I have?

User:  Yes.
Alexa: Number 1 was authored 3 days ago* by you: Test merge request

### Pipelines

User:  Run a new deployment pipeline
Alexa: Sure, what's the ID of the project? You can find the project ID on the project's page on Gitlab.com underneath the project name.
User:  14193928.
Alexa: Great, I'll use project 14193928 as your default project so you won't have to specify it in the future.
Alexa: Hooray! A deployment pipeline has been created.

Subsequent invocations of this intent will not ask for the project ID. For example:

User:  Run a new deployment pipeline
Alexa: Hooray! A deployment pipeline has been created.
